# boot-loader
An extremely simple boot-loader - just as a learning project

## build on Mac/Linux

Run as root or "sudo" build_boot.sh

The script produces two files:

* an image file - floppy.img - use that in a floppy-device in your preferred virtual/emulated setup e.g. virtualbox.

* a binary file - boot.bin - use that to write to a disk, cd-rom etc, or use in a virtural/emulated setup.
